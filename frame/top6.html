        <h2>Penicillin: The First Antibiotic</h2>
        <p>Discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, penicillin was the first antibiotic that successfully treated bacterial infections. This groundbreaking discovery revolutionized medicine and saved countless lives, marking the beginning of the antibiotic era.</p>

        <p>Penicillin works by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria, making it a powerful treatment for diseases such as pneumonia, strep throat, and syphilis. Its discovery earned Fleming the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945, shared with Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain for their efforts in developing it for widespread use.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Modern Society</h2>
        <p>Penicillin has been called the "miracle drug" due to its profound impact on healthcare. Before its discovery, bacterial infections were often fatal. Its development not only extended human life expectancy but also paved the way for the creation of other life-saving antibiotics.</p>

        <p>Today, antibiotics remain a cornerstone of modern medicine. Penicillin's discovery has contributed to safer surgical procedures, effective treatment of infections, and advancements in medical research. It remains one of the most significant medical breakthroughs in history.</p>
